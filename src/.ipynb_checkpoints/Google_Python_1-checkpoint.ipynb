      "# Google's Python Class\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome to Google's Python Class -- this is a free class for people with a little bit of programming experience who want to learn Python. The class includes written materials, lecture videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding. These materials are used within Google to introduce Python to people who have just a little programming experience. The first exercises work on basic Python concepts like strings and lists, building up to the later exercises which are full programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections. The class is geared for people who have a little bit of programming experience in some language, enough to know what a \"variable\" or \"if statement\" is. Beyond that, you do not need to be an expert programmer to use this material.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get started, the Python sections are linked at the left -- Python Set Up to get Python installed on your machine, Python Introduction for an introduction to the language, and then Python Strings starts the coding material, leading to the first exercise. The end of each written section includes a link to the code exercise for that section's material. The lecture videos parallel the written materials, introducing Python, then strings, then first exercises, and so on. At Google, all this material makes up an intensive 2-day class, so the videos are organized as the day-1 and day-2 sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "This material was created by Nick Parlante working in the engEDU group at Google. Special thanks for the help from my Google colleagues John Cox, Steve Glassman, Piotr Kaminksi, and Antoine Picard. And finally thanks to Google and my director Maggie Johnson for the enlightened generosity to put these materials out on the internet for free under the under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license -- share and enjoy!\n",

      "\n",
      "This page explains how to set up Python on a machine so you can run and edit Python programs, and links to the exercise code to download. You can do this before starting the class, or you can leave it until you've gotten far enough in the class that you want to write some code. The Google Python Class uses a simple, standard Python installation, although more complex strategies are possible. Python is free and open source, available for all operating systems from python.org. In particular we want a Python install where you can do two things:\n",
      "\n",
      "Run an existing python program, such as hello.py\n",
      "Run the Python interpreter interactively, so you can type code right at it\n",
      "Both of the above are done quite a lot in the lecture videos, and it's definitely something you need to be able to do to solve the exercises\n",

      "## Download Google Python Exercises\n",
      "\n",
      "As a first step, download the google-python-exercises.zip file and unzip it someplace where you can work on it. The resulting google-python-exercises directory contains many different python code exercises you can work on. In particular, google-python-exercises contains a simple hello.py file you can use in the next step to check that Python is working on your machine. Below are Python instructions for Windows and all other operation systems:\n",

      "To edit Python, we advocate the strategy that when you hit the tab key, your editor inserts spaces rather than a real tab character. All our files use 2-spaces as the indent, and 4-spaces is another popular choice. It's also handy if the editor will \"auto indent\" so when you hit return, the new line starts with the same indentation as the previous line. We also recommend saving your files with the unix line-ending convention, since that's how the various starter files are set up. If running hello.py gives the error \"Unknown option: -\", the file may have the wrong line-ending. Here are the preferences to set for common editors to treat tabs and line-endings correctly for Python:\n",

Change the word \"Hello\" in the code to the word \"Howdy\" (you don't need to understand all the other Python code in there ... we'll explain it all in class). Save your edits and run the program to see its new output. Try adding a \"print 'yay!'\" just below the existing print and with the same indentation. Try running the program, to see that your edits work correctly. For class we want an edit/run workflow that allows you to switch between editing and running easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quick Python Style\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the advantages of Python is that it makes it easy to type a little code and quickly see what it does. In class, we want a work setup that matches that .. a text text editor working on the current file.py, and a separate command line window where you can just hit the up-arrow key to run file.py and see what it does. (Teaching philosophy aside: the interpreter is great for little experiments, as shown throughout the lectures. However, the exercises are structured as Python files that students edit. Since being able to write Python programs is the ultimate goal, I felt it was best to be in that mode the whole time, using the interpreter just for little experiments.)\n"
