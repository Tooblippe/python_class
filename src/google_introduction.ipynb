      "# Python Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Python is a dynamic, interpreted language. Source code does not declare the types of variables or parameters or methods. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking in the source code. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs. (todo: link here to the companion video segment for this section)\n",
      "\n",
      "An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreter and type code right into it. If you ever have a question like \"what happens if I add an int to a list?\" ... just typing it into the Python interpreter is fast way to see what happens. Python code does not declare the types of variables -- just assign to them and go. Python raises a runtime error if the code tries to read from a variable that has not been given a value. Like C++ and Java, Python is case sensitive so \"a\" and \"A\" are different variables. The end of a line marks the end of a statement, so unlike C++ and Java, Python does not require a semicolon at the end of each statement. You can include semicolons at the end of Python statements (perhaps just out of habit), but it's not the best style. Comments begin with a '#' and extend to the end of the line. (See Python Set Up for how to install and Python on various operating systems.)"
